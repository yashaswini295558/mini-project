Requirements
Introduction
The simple calculator used to perform operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, factorial and modulus functions.
 This topic was chosen because it gives me an opportunity to implement efficient data structures and provides me flexibility to understand multiple C programming concepts.

Research
			
      The research is a synthesis of nearly 200 research studies on calculator use in the classroom. The goal is to provide practitioners and researches advice on how the research knowledge base can guide classroom practice and support future research. It shows that the use of calculators in the teaching and learning of mathematics.

  Benefits
    Promotes Accuracy
        Calculators aren’t just for cutting corners. They can reassure students that their work has paid off or encourage students to go back and try again.
Builds Comfort with Technology
Turns out all of us are dependent on technology. If you depend on your car or the bus to get you to work, you’re dependent on technology.

Makes Math More Enjoyable
Calculators take the pressure off students who would otherwise beat themselves up over the little things.

SWOT ANALYSIS

Strengths
Strengths are things that your organization does particularly well.These might be the motivation of your staff, access to certain materials, or a strong set of manufacturing processes.
Weaknesses
Weaknesses, like strengths, are inherent features of your organization, so focus on your people, resources, systems, and procedures. Think about what you could improve, and the sorts of practices you should avoid.
Opportunities
Opportunities are openings or chances for something positive to happen, but you'll need to claim them for yourself!
They usually arise from situations outside your organization, and require an eye to what might happen in the future. They might arise as developments in the market you serve, or in the technology you use. 
Threats
Threats include anything that can negatively affect your business from the outside, such as supply chain problems, shifts in market requirements, or a shortage of recruits. It's vital to anticipate threats and to take action against them before you become a victim of them and your growth stalls
